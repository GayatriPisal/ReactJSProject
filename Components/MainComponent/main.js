            <p>People often find it difficult to concentrate on the discourse of those around them. Although they “hear” well enough, they find it difficult to really “listen,” i.e., hear, understand, analyze, and form a response after thorough consideration. Despite this, humans are known to have an inherent ability to put themselves in others’ shoes. All they need to do is increase their attention span and observation skills. The same can be achieved by mentally dividing the discourse of the person talking based on the following questions: 1) Do I understand the gist of the problem/situation/perspective that is being presented before me? 2) What can my contribution therein be? Can I help this person/benefit from this person in any way? 3) What options are there; what possible consequences can each of them have?
Trying to answer these questions will definitely ensure concentration on what others have to say.

            <p>One of the main problems people encounter pertaining to planning and organizing is a difficulty in making a proper schedule for themselves. People often fail to accurately estimate how long a task will take to reach the stage of its accomplishment. Consequently, they end up spending a large percentage of their time and resources over certain tasks, while others remain entirely neglected/rushed. To overcome this, it is important to make it a point to draft a schedule/timetable and stick to it. People can consult their more experienced colleagues and peers for this. If they stick to the plan, they will be able to dedicate just the right amount of time to every task (not more, not less) and ensure that it is completed on time.

           <p>Although most people feel grateful towards people around them for their contributions/help, they find it difficult to express their appreciation verbally or through actions. One of the reasons for this might be an underlying lack of surety regarding whether their gesture will be appreciated by their listeners. The best way is to remember that people like to be complimented and appreciated for whatever they do. One win-win positive point about expressing gratitude is that it makes both the speaker and the listener feel good. Start with saying “thank you” for every time someone else does something for you. This habit can be inculcated both in domestic and professional spheres. Realize that there is no embarrassment I saying the two magic words.
